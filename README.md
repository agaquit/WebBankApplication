!! IMPORTANT !! 
I published the website yesterday 20th January and it worked fine, when I tried to visit the website this morning 21th January I got an HTTP Error 500.30 without touching the application.
I tried visiting the website again after an hour and it worked fine again. I screen recorded everything when the website works with all the requirement needed to pass the assignment both
by doing it on the website and locally. Here is the video of that in case you can't access the website: https://youtu.be/QQuEFKIxEFQ
